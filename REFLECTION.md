AI Attribution: If you used GenAI (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) to help write code, you must include the prompt you used and explain one logic error the AI made that you had to fix manually.

I did not use GenAI. 
I used the automatic ai in visual studio code to help write code when it predicts what words I want to type. For example, when I wanted to add a class, after I manually added the class tag to some sections, it predicted it when I started typing again. I  use ai to quickly write both the open and close tags when it comes up, for example, when I was making the lists, it would predict <li> </li> and I would accept it instead of manually typing it out to be quicker.
An error it made was when I added a class and id in the same tag to do the specificity challenge and it wanted to delete the ' id=" ' so that it became only a class with combinated name of both the class and id name.
