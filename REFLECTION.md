Describe the path an HTTP Request takes from a browser to your GitHub Pages site.

The browser sends an HTTP request over the internet to the github server. The github server then sends the HTML back to the browser through the internet and the browser renders the HTML into the github page site.


We discussed Docker Containers in class. Explain how a Docker Container differs from the environment provided by GitHub Pages.

A docker container allows an application to run in an isolated environment. A docker image have all the files, libraries and packages needed to run the application.

Github is more for coding and collaborating. In github, multiple people can work in the same repositories, making branches and merging. It is for coding and tracking the changes.



AI Attribution: If you used GenAI (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) to help write code, you must include the prompt you used and explain one logic error the AI made that you had to fix manually.

I did not use GenAI to generate code. 
I did use the automatic ai in visual studio code to help write code when it predicts what I want to type. For example, when I wanted to add a class to muiltple tags, after I manually added a class to some tags, it predicted it when I start typing again.

An error it made was when I added a class and id in the same tag to do the specificity challenge and it wanted to delete the ' id=" ' so that it became only a class with a combined name of both the class and id name.
